# TODO List for Handwriting Writer Identification Backend

## Project Setup

- [x] Create project directory: "handwriting-identification-backend"
- [x] Set up Python virtual environment
- [x] Install dependencies (FastAPI, Uvicorn, Motor, TensorFlow, Pillow, etc.)

## Core Files Creation

- [x] Create config.py for DB and app settings
- [x] Create models.py for MongoDB schemas (Persons, HandwritingSamples, Cases)
- [x] Create ai_model.py for handwriting feature extraction and similarity scoring
- [x] Create utils.py for image preprocessing
- [x] Create app.py for main FastAPI application
- [x] Create routes/ directory and files:
  - [x] routes/**init**.py
  - [x] routes/cases.py (endpoints for case management)
  - [x] routes/samples.py (endpoints for sample uploads)
  - [x] routes/matching.py (endpoints for matching and searching)
  - [x] routes/persons.py (endpoints for person details)

## Features Implementation

- [x] Implement image upload and storage
- [x] Implement case creation and suspect linking
- [x] Implement handwriting matching against suspects
- [x] Implement global database search
- [x] Integrate AI model for feature extraction and similarity
- [x] Add report generation for matches

## Testing and Refinement

- [x] Add basic error handling and logging
- [x] Test basic endpoints locally
- [x] Run app with Uvicorn
- [x] Verify AI model integration
- [x] Add unit tests if needed

## AI/ML Enhancements

- [ ] Implement model training pipeline
- [ ] Add data augmentation for training
- [x] Implement model saving/loading functionality
- [ ] Enhance image preprocessing techniques
- [ ] Add training data management
- [ ] Implement model evaluation metrics
- [ ] Add background training tasks
- [ ] Improve feature extraction architecture
- [ ] Add model versioning and checkpointing
- [ ] Implement training data collection endpoints

## Implementation Steps

- [x] Enhance train_model() in ai_model.py for custom datasets and hyperparameter tuning
- [x] Integrate data augmentation into training pipeline
- [x] Improve model saving/loading with better versioning
- [x] Add more image preprocessing techniques (noise reduction, etc.)
- [x] Add database integration for training data management in utils.py
- [x] Enhance evaluate_model() with more metrics and visualization
- [x] Add background training tasks with endpoints
- [x] Add options for different feature extraction architectures
- [x] Improve model versioning and checkpointing system
- [x] Create routes/training.py for training data collection endpoints
- [x] Add new models for training data and model versions in models.py
- [x] Register new routes in app.py
- [x] Test new endpoints
- [x] Run training pipeline

## Followup

- [x] Install dependencies in virtual env
- [x] Run the app locally (uvicorn app:app --reload)
- [x] Test basic endpoints (e.g., upload sample)
- [x] Integrate AI model (train/load pre-trained if needed)
- [ ] Add authentication/security later if required
